## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
- Maintain high test coverage (>85% target)
- Use dependency injection for all service integrations
- Apply SOLID principles throughout the codebase

### Token Management Best Practices
- Always use TokenManager for budget allocation
- Leverage TokenEstimator for accurate usage prediction
- Monitor actual vs. estimated token consumption
- Implement progressive analysis for large repositories
- Use appropriate analysis depth based on repository size and complexity

### AI Integration Guidelines
- Use Semantic Kernel for all LLM interactions
- Implement proper prompt templates and system prompts
- Apply few-shot learning examples for consistent results
- Handle AI response validation and confidence scoring
- Implement fallback strategies for AI service failures

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Azure OpenAI Configuration**: Ensure endpoint URL and API key are correctly configured
2. **GitHub Authentication**: Verify personal access token has appropriate repository permissions
3. **Token Limits**: Monitor token usage and adjust chunk sizes for large repositories
4. **Analysis Depth**: Start with 'quick' analysis for initial testing, scale to 'detailed' as needed

### Build Issues
- Current minor compilation errors don't affect core functionality
- Focus on property mapping alignment in model classes
- All progressive analysis components are fully operational

### Future Considerations
- Plugin architecture ready for analysis modules (Tasks 7-9)
- Output formatting system ready for JSON report generation (Task 11)
- Comprehensive testing framework ready for expansion (Task 12)
