Do not over explain what you have done, perform the tasks and only explain if you need input from me.

The PRD is stored here: OpenDeepResearch\scripts\scripts\PRD.md

Use Context7 tool server to understand anything you need to know about Semantic Kernel.

When you finish a TaskMaster task in its entirety, generate a commit message

Always use powershell syntax when running commands:

Bad: cd c:\Code\0.1-DeepWikiCustom && dotnet build
